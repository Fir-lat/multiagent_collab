{"Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?": ["First, let's find out how many eggs are left after Janet takes three for breakfast and uses four for muffins. \n\n16 (total eggs laid) - 3 (for breakfast) - 4 (for muffins) = 9 eggs\n\nThen, we'll find out how many of those eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market. \n\n9 (remaining eggs) - 0 (she saves none for other uses) = 9 eggs\n\nFinally, we'll multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg to get her total earnings.\n\n9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = \\boxed{18}. So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.", "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"], "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?": ["To find out how many bolts of fiber it takes to make one robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber and the amount of white fiber needed.\n\nThe problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It also states that a robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it would take half of that amount for the white fiber. Half of 2 is 1, so the robe takes 1 bolt of white fiber.\n\nNow, to find out how many bolts of fiber it takes to make one robe in total, we need to add the amount of blue fiber and the amount of white fiber together.\n\n2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts\n\nSo, it takes \\boxed{3} bolts of fiber to make one robe.", "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"]}
