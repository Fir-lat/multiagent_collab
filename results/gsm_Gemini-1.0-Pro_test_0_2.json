{"Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?": ["## Janet's Duck Egg Sales\n\nHere's how we can calculate Janet's daily earnings from selling duck eggs:\n\n1. **Eggs laid:** 16 eggs/day\n2. **Eggs eaten:** 3 eggs/day\n3. **Eggs used for baking:** 4 eggs/day\n4. **Eggs sold:** 16 eggs/day - 3 eggs/day - 4 eggs/day = 9 eggs/day\n5. **Earnings per day:** 9 eggs/day * $2/egg = $18/day\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $\\boxed{18}$ dollars every day at the farmers' market selling duck eggs. \n", "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"], "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?": ["## Robe Fiber Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Determine white fiber needed.**\n\nA robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and **half that much** white fiber. So, the white fiber needed is:\n\n```\n2 bolts (blue fiber) * 1/2 = 1 bolt (white fiber)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Calculate total bolts needed.**\n\nTo find the total bolts needed, we add the blue and white fiber needs:\n\n```\n2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts (total)\n```\n\nTherefore, a robe takes a total of **3 bolts** of fiber.\n\n## Conclusion \n\nA robe requires a total of 3 bolts of fiber, with 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber.\n\n## Final Answer\n\n$\\boxed{3}$", "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"]}
