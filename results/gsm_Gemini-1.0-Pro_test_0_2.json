{"Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?": ["## Janet's Duck Egg Sales\n\nHere's how we can calculate Janet's daily earnings from selling duck eggs:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining after Janet eats and bakes:**\n    * Eggs laid per day: 16\n    * Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3\n    * Eggs used for baking: 4\n    * Remaining eggs for sale: 16 - 3 - 4 = 9\n\n2. **Calculate Janet's daily earnings:**\n    * Price per egg: $2\n    * Eggs sold: 9\n    * Daily earnings: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $\\boxed{18}$ dollars every day selling duck eggs at the farmers' market. \n", "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"], "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?": ["## Robe Fiber Calculation\n\nA robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. \n\nIt also requires half as much white fiber, which means it needs 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.\n\nTherefore, in total, the robe requires 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts of fiber.\n\n## Answer\n\n$\\boxed{3}$", "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"]}
