{"Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?": ["Sure! Let's break this down:\n\n1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. She uses 3 for her breakfast and 4 for baking muffins, so she has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left.\n3. She then sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.\n4. So, her earnings from the farmers' market are 9 * $2 = $18.\n\nTherefore, Janet makes \\boxed{18} dollars every day at the farmers' market.", "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"], "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?": ["To find out how many bolts in total it takes to make one robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber and the amount of white fiber needed.\n\nThe problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. For the white fiber, it takes half as much as the blue fiber. Half of 2 is 1, so it takes 1 bolt of white fiber.\n\nNow, to find the total number of bolts needed for one robe, we simply add the 2 bolts of blue fiber and the 1 bolt of white fiber:\n\n2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts\n\nSo, it takes \\boxed{3} bolts of fiber in total to make one robe.", "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"]}
