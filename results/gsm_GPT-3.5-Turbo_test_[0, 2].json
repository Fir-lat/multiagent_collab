{"Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?": ["Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast and bakes muffins with four. This leaves her with 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs to sell at the farmers' market.\nSince she sells each fresh duck egg for $2, she makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. Answer: \\boxed{18}.", "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"], "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?": ["Let's first find out how much white fiber is needed for the robe. We are given that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the white fiber needed would be half of that, which is 2/2 = 1 bolt.\n\nSo, in total, the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. \n\nTherefore, it takes a total of 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 bolts. \n\nHence, the answer is \\boxed{3}.", "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"]}
