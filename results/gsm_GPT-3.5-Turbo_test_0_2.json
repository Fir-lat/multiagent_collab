{"Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?": ["Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins with four. Therefore, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 eggs each day for breakfast and muffins.\nThe remainder of the eggs is 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 eggs that she can sell at the farmers' market.\nSince she sells each fresh duck egg for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. Answer: \\boxed{18}.", "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"], "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?": ["Let's assume that the number of bolts of white fiber required is x.\n\nSince the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, it means that the number of bolts of white fiber required is half of the number of bolts of blue fiber. Hence, we can write the equation:\n\nx = 1/2 * 2\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\nx = 1\n\nTherefore, it takes 1 bolt of white fiber. Adding this to the 2 bolts of blue fiber, the total number of bolts required is:\n\n2 + 1 = 3\n\nHence, it takes \\boxed{3} bolts in total.", "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"]}
