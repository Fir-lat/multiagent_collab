{"Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?": ["## Janet's Daily Duck Egg Sales\n\nHere's how we can calculate Janet's daily earnings from selling duck eggs at the farmers' market:\n\n1. **Eggs laid:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. **Eggs consumed:** She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins, totaling 3 + 4 = 7 eggs consumed.\n3. **Eggs sold:** She sells the remaining eggs at the market. So, she sells 16 eggs laid - 7 eggs consumed = 9 eggs.\n4. **Earnings:** She sells each egg for $2, so her daily earnings are 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $\\boxed{18}$ dollars every day selling duck eggs at the farmers' market. \n", "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"], "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?": ["## Robe Fiber Calculation\n\nTo find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to consider the amounts of blue and white fiber required.\n\n**Blue Fiber:**\n\n* The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n\n**White Fiber:**\n\n* The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber.\n* Therefore, it requires 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.\n\n**Total Bolts:**\n\n* To find the total number of bolts, we add the amount of blue and white fiber:\n* Total bolts = blue fiber bolts + white fiber bolts\n* Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt\n* Total bolts = 3 bolts\n\nTherefore, the robe requires a total of 3 bolts of fiber.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe robe requires a total of 3 bolts of fiber, consisting of 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber.\n\n## Final Answer \n\n$\\boxed{3}$", "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"]}
